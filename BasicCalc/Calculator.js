// Problem Statement:-
// Create a simple calculator which can perform arithmetic operations such as +, -, *, / on two integer operands.

// Requirements
// The page must contain two text type input fields to accept operands and radio buttons to input an operator.

// By default '+' must be checked. On clicking the 'Calculate' button, the arithmetic operation must be performed and result must be rounded off to 3 decimal places and displayed in green color.

// Both the operands must be provided as input. Otherwise on clicking the 'Calculate' button, an error message must be displayed in red as "Input all values"

// The operands must contain only numerical values. Otherwise on clicking the 'Calculate' button, an error message "Operands can only be digits" should be displayed in red

// Make sure that user does not divide a number by zero. If the user tries to divide a number by zero, then display error message "Cannot divide by 0" in red

// If result goes beyond -100000 to 1000000, an error instance with message "Result out of bounds" must be thrown.
